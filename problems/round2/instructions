There are 3 directories located in home directory.

[*]executables: it contains executable binaries. You have to fetch flag from these binaries.
[*]source: it contains source code for each binary. The first line of each file shows points for that perticular problem. It's in formate: [x,y,z], where x=points you earn if solve it without any hints; y=point you get if you take hint1; z=points you get if you take hint2. Next few lines are abstract of a problem. The actual flag and password are replaced with keywords 'flag' and 'secret' respectively.(for obvious reasons)
[*]hints: it contains all the hints. however, you are not given read access for them. Ask for it if you need it.

solve as many problems as you can, as fast as you can.
